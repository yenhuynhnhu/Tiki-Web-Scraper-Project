# Tiki-Web-Scraper-Project
This repository is to show a Jupyter Notebook that I did the project of scraping data from Tiki website. My project is guided by youtuber Alex The Analyst through his Amazon web scraping using Python project.

Through this project, I've learned:
- how to use Jupyter Notebook to write code. Previously I was only familiar with VSCode.
- how to scrape data from a website at the fundamental level.
- how to insert dataset into a csv file.
- libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests.
